# Demystifying Dimensionality Reduction: From PCA to UMAP with Real-World Cases

> A practical guide to understanding dimensionality reduction techniques and their real-world applications.


## 📖 Introduction

**Def**: Dimensionality reduction (DR) transforms high-dimensional data (e.g., 1000 features) into a lower-dimensional space (e.g., 3 features) while preserving critical patterns. 

**Analogy**: Like compressing a high-resolution photo into a smaller file without losing recognizability.
* **Key Vocabulary**
    - **Feature**: An individual measurable property or characteristic of a dataset.
    - **Dimension**: Each feature represents a dimension in the data space.

## 🧠 When to Use Dimensionality Reduction

- Training is slow due to many features

- Features are highly correlated (e.g., > 0.8)

- Model accuracy plateaus with more features

## 🔥 Why It Matters

- **Curse of Dimensionality**: As feature count increases, data becomes sparse, models overfit, and computations become expensive.

- **Improved Generalization**: Simplifies learning, potentially leading to better accuracy and generalization.

- **Visualization**: Makes it feasible to plot and interpret high-dimensional data.
- **Noise Reduction**: Removes irrelevant/noisy features, improving signal-to-noise ratio.

## ⚙️ Main Approaches for dimensionality reduction. 

### 1. Feature Selection
- **Definition**: Choosing a subset of the original features (columns) that are most relevant to the task.
- **Goal**: Remove redundant, irrelevant, or noisy features while keeping the data interpretable.
- **Techniques**:
    - **Filter Methods**: Use statistical measures (e.g., variance threshold, correlation-based selection).
    - **Wrapper Methods**: Evaluate different feature subsets using model performance (e.g., recursive feature elimination).
    - **Embedded Methods**: Feature selection integrated into model training (e.g., LASSO, tree-based models).
- **Pros**: Simple, interpretable, fast.
- **Cons**: May miss important feature interactions.

### 2. Feature Extraction (Projection)
- **Definition:** Transforming the original features into a new set of features (components) that capture the most important information.
- **Goal:** Compress data into fewer dimensions, often by combining features in ways that maximize variance or preserve structure.
- **Techniques**:
    - **Linear Methods**:
        - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Projects data onto axes of maximum variance.
        - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Maximizes class separability (supervised).
        - **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**: Finds statistically independent components.
        - **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**: Factorizes data into non-negative components.
    - **Nonlinear Methods**:
        - **t-SNE**: Preserves local similarities for visualization.
        - **UMAP**: Balances local/global structure, faster than t-SNE.
        - **Isomap, LLE**: Preserve manifold structure.
        - **Autoencoders**: Neural networks learn compressed representations.
- **Pros**: Captures more structure, powerful.
- **Cons**: Less interpretable, can be complex.
